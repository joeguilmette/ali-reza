## 3. Safety

**Heading:** Safety — A Straight Answer

Afghanistan has a complex security environment that varies significantly by region and changes over time. Some parts of the country are calm, accessible, and genuinely welcoming to visitors. Others are not. Ali Reza only operates in regions he knows well and has current ground intelligence about.

**How Ali Reza manages safety:**

- Every itinerary is built against current conditions, not against last year's conditions. Routes are adjusted when necessary.
- Ali Reza maintains active networks with community leaders, local drivers, and contacts in every region he operates in. He knows what's happening on the ground.
- All multi-day trips carry a satellite phone. Remote trips include a secondary emergency contact plan.
- Ali Reza is a certified Wilderness First Responder. A full first aid and trauma kit is carried on every trip.
- Travel insurance with emergency evacuation coverage is **mandatory** for all travelers. No exceptions.
- No trip departs if conditions are not right. If Ali Reza cancels or changes a trip for security reasons, a full refund or rescheduling option is offered.

**What travelers should understand:**
Afghanistan is not a conventional tourist destination. Risks exist that do not exist in most other places. A trip here requires a higher level of trust in your guide, a greater tolerance for uncertainty, and the right insurance in place. Ali Reza will not take you somewhere he doesn't believe is safe. But he also cannot guarantee anything. That's the honest answer.

## 4. Visa & Entry

**Heading:** Visa & Entry Requirements

Most international visitors require a visa to enter Afghanistan.

**How to apply:**
- Apply through the Afghan Embassy or Consulate in your home country. Requirements and processing times vary.
- Some nationalities may apply for a visa on arrival at Kabul airport — confirm this with the Afghan Embassy before traveling.
- An e-visa system has been available intermittently; check current status before applying.

**Support from Ali Reza:**
Ali Reza can provide an official invitation letter from the agency to support your visa application. This is often required or helpful. Request it when you book.

**Afghan nationals and dual passport holders:**
If you hold an Afghan passport or are a dual national, entry requirements differ. Contact Ali Reza before applying — the process is straightforward but distinct.

**Useful contacts:**

## 5. Health

**Heading:** Health & Vaccinations

**Recommended vaccinations:**
Consult your doctor or a travel health clinic 6–8 weeks before departure.

- Hepatitis A — strongly recommended for all travelers
- Hepatitis B — recommended for most
- Typhoid — recommended
- Tetanus/Diphtheria — should be up to date
- Rabies — recommended for any trip involving rural areas or wildlife (Wakhan especially)
- COVID-19 — confirm current requirements

**Altitude:**
Several destinations sit at high altitude. Band-e-Amir is at 2,900m. Wakhan valley floor is 2,800–3,000m. High passes in the Wakhan exceed 4,500m.

Symptoms of altitude sickness (headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue) can appear above 2,500m. Ali Reza builds acclimatization days into high-altitude itineraries. Travelers with heart or lung conditions should consult a doctor before booking any high-altitude trip.

**Medications:**
Bring a sufficient supply of any prescription medication, clearly labeled. Some medications may be difficult or impossible to obtain in Afghanistan.

**Medical facilities:**
Kabul has several functioning hospitals and clinics. In rural regions, medical facilities are limited or absent. Ali Reza's WFR certification and on-trip medical kit are the first line of response for field incidents.

**Water:**
Do not drink tap water. Bottled water is available in cities. On remote trips, Ali Reza carries water purification tablets and a filter.

## 7. Money & Budget

**Heading:** Money in Afghanistan

**Currency:** Afghan Afghani (AFN). The exchange rate fluctuates; check before you travel.

**USD:** Widely accepted in cities, particularly for larger transactions. Bring clean, unmarked notes in good condition (torn or marked notes are often refused).

**ATMs:** International ATMs do not function reliably in Afghanistan. **Bring all the cash you will need.** Ali Reza can advise on the right amount based on your itinerary.

**Money changers:** Kabul's Sarai Shahzada (the money market) offers reliable exchange. In other cities, money changers are available in bazaars.

**Rough daily costs:**

| Category | Approx. Cost |
|---|---|
| Budget guesthouse | $15–30/night |
| Mid-range hotel (Kabul) | $60–120/night |
| Street food meal | $2–5 |
| Restaurant meal | $8–20 |
| Domestic flight | $80–150 one way |
| Local driver (day rate) | $50–80 |

Tour prices include accommodation and meals as specified. Personal spending money is additional.

**Tipping:**
Tipping is appreciated but not expected. A reasonable guide tip for a multi-day tour: $10–20/day. Drivers: $5–10/day. These are suggestions, not requirements.

## 8. Culture & Etiquette

**Heading:** Culture, Customs, and How to Be a Good Guest

Afghanistan is a conservative Muslim country. Visitors who approach with respect and genuine curiosity are welcomed with extraordinary hospitality. A few things to know:

**Dress**
- Men: Long trousers and covered shoulders in rural areas and religious sites. Kabul is more relaxed.
- Women: Modest clothing throughout. A headscarf is required outside Kabul's most international areas and is strongly recommended everywhere. Long sleeves and loose trousers or a long skirt.
- Ali Reza will give specific guidance for each part of the itinerary.

**Photography**
Always ask before photographing people. Some communities — particularly women and elders — may decline. Respect this without negotiation. Ali Reza facilitates portrait introductions in communities where he has relationships; do not photograph independently without checking with him.

**Greeting customs**
- The standard greeting is *Salaam alaikum* ("Peace be upon you"), responded to with *Wa alaikum assalam*.
- Men greet men with a handshake and often a hand on the heart. Men should not initiate physical greetings with women.
- Shoes are removed before entering homes and mosques.

**Eating and hospitality**
If invited to someone's home — and you may well be — bring a small gift (sweets or fruit are appropriate). Eat with the right hand. Accept tea when offered; refusing can be impolite. You will almost certainly be offered more food than you can eat. This is normal and generous.

**Ramadan**
Eating, drinking, or smoking in public during Ramadan daylight hours is inappropriate. Ali Reza will brief you fully if your trip falls during Ramadan. It is possible to travel during Ramadan; the experience is simply different.

**Religion**
Islam is central to Afghan life and identity. Approach it with curiosity and respect. Questions about religion are welcome in conversation — Afghans are generally happy to explain their faith and practice to interested visitors.

## 10. FAQ

**Heading:** Frequently Asked Questions

Accordion list. One item open by default (the first one).

**Is Afghanistan safe to visit?**
It depends on where you go and how you travel. Some regions are calm and welcoming. Others are not. Ali Reza only takes travelers to places he knows and trusts. He monitors conditions constantly and adjusts plans when needed. No guide can guarantee safety anywhere in the world — but traveling with a deeply experienced local guide who has 15 years of in-country knowledge is the single most important safety measure you can take.

**Do I need a visa?**
Most nationalities do. Apply through your nearest Afghan Embassy or Consulate. Ali Reza can provide an invitation letter to support your application. See the Visa section above for more detail.

**Can women travel to Afghanistan?**
Yes. Several women have traveled with Ali Reza as solo travelers and in groups. Afghanistan is a conservative country and modest dress is important throughout. Ali Reza provides specific guidance for each destination. Female travelers should be aware that some interactions will be mediated differently than in Western contexts — this is something Ali Reza navigates actively and sensitively.

**What language do people speak?**
Dari (a dialect of Persian/Farsi) and Pashto are the two official languages. Dari is the most widely spoken in urban areas and across most of the country. In the Wakhan Corridor, Wakhi is spoken. In the north, Uzbek and Turkmen are common. Ali Reza is fluent in Dari, Pashto, and English, and works with local interpreters where needed.

**What is the best time of year to visit?**
Spring (April–June) and autumn (September–October) are ideal for most destinations — mild temperatures, clear skies, flowers in spring. Summer (July–August) is hot in the lowlands but perfect for high-altitude destinations like Wakhan. Winter limits access to most highland areas but Kabul and Mazar are accessible year-round.

**Can I use my phone and data?**
Afghan SIM cards (Roshan, MTN, Etisalat) provide decent data coverage in cities and along main roads. In remote areas — Wakhan, Nuristan, highland plateaus — coverage disappears entirely. Ali Reza carries a satellite phone on all remote trips.

**What currency should I bring?**
US dollars in cash (clean, unmarked notes). Some transactions in cities will be in Afghani; Ali Reza handles exchange for those. Do not rely on cards or ATMs.

**Is alcohol available?**
No. Afghanistan is a dry country. Alcohol is not available and should not be brought in.

**Can I travel independently without a guide?**
Technically possible, but strongly inadvisable for first-time visitors and for most destinations covered on this site. The logistics, language, security awareness, and community access that Ali Reza provides are not things a first-time visitor can replicate. For most travelers, a guide is not optional — it's what makes the trip possible.

**What happens if security conditions change after I book?**
If Ali Reza determines that a trip cannot safely proceed as planned, he will contact you immediately. Options: a modified itinerary, a rescheduled departure, or a full refund. Ali Reza has never sent a traveler into a situation he wasn't confident in, and has modified or postponed trips when conditions required it.

**What should I do if I have a medical emergency on a trip?**
Ali Reza carries a full first aid and trauma kit and is a certified Wilderness First Responder. For serious emergencies, the satellite phone is used to contact emergency services and, if necessary, coordinate medical evacuation. All travelers are required to carry travel insurance with emergency evacuation coverage before departure.
