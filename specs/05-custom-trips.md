# Page: Custom Trips

**Goal:** Convert visitors with specific needs — photographers, diaspora, researchers, journalists — who won't find what they want in the standard tour menu. Lower the friction to start a conversation.

## 1. Hero

Photo of Ali Reza with a small group in a remote setting — not a scenic shot, a human one. People talking, planning, pointing at a map.

**Headline:** Your Afghanistan, Your Way
**Subheadline:** Have a specific route, a project, or a region you need to reach? Ali Reza will build the trip around you.

## 2. Opening Copy

Short paragraph, no heading needed:

*Most of Ali Reza's most memorable trips weren't on any menu. A documentary filmmaker who needed access to a Kyrgyz family for two weeks. A photographer tracking the ancient lapis lazuli trade. An Afghan-American family returning to their ancestral province for the first time in thirty years. A journalist embedding with a rural community for a feature story.*

*If you know what you want — or even if you only have a rough idea — start a conversation. Ali Reza will tell you honestly what's possible and what isn't, and build from there.*

## 3. How It Works

Four steps in a horizontal sequence. On mobile, stack vertically.

**Step 1 — Tell Us Your Vision**
Fill out the form below. Dates, interests, group size, what you're hoping to experience or accomplish. The more you share, the better Ali Reza can respond.

**Step 2 — Ali Reza Designs Your Route**
Within 48 hours, you'll receive a draft itinerary. Not a template — a real plan built around your goals, including honest notes on what conditions permit.

**Step 3 — Refine Together**
One or two rounds of back-and-forth until the plan is exactly right. Dates, accommodation, pace, specific communities or locations you want to include.

**Step 4 — We Handle Everything On the Ground**
Permits, transport, guides, guesthouses, logistics, contingency planning. You show up. Ali Reza takes care of the rest.

## 4. Who This Is For

**Heading:** Custom Trips Are Right For You If...

Two-column list, icon + item each:

- You're a **photographer or filmmaker** seeking specific landscapes, communities, or access
- You're **Afghan diaspora** reconnecting with family, ancestral home, or a region you've never seen
- You're a **journalist or researcher** who needs time in a specific community or region
- You want to **travel at your own pace** — not on a fixed group schedule
- You have a **private group** (family, friends, colleagues) who want to travel together
- You need **a short trip** (1–2 days) that doesn't fit a packaged itinerary
- You have **specific accessibility or medical needs** that require a customized plan
- You want to **combine regions** that don't appear together in any standard itinerary

---

## 5. What Can Be Customized

Three columns, heading + short list each.

**Route & Regions**
Any combination of destinations Ali Reza covers. Mix regions that don't appear on the same standard tour. Extend or shorten any leg.

**Pace & Style**
Slow travel, fast travel, photography-focused days, rest days built in, village homestays vs. guesthouses, camping vs. hotels.

**Group & Budget**
Solo travelers welcome. Groups of any size up to 12. Every custom trip is priced transparently based on what it actually includes.

## 6. Sample Custom Trips

**Heading:** Examples of Custom Trips We've Run

Three cards, each with a brief description of a real (or representative) custom trip:

**The Lapis Road**

**Coming Home**
A 10-day family trip for an Afghan-American family of five visiting their ancestral village in Logar Province for the first time. Included a formal meeting with village elders, a visit to the family's original home, and side trips to Kabul and Bamiyan.

**The Long Walk**
A 16-day trekking expedition connecting Bamiyan, the Band-e-Amir plateau, and the Hazarajat highlands on foot. Client: two experienced trekkers from Switzerland. Almost entirely off-trail. No previous tourist record of the full route exists.
