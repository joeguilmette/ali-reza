**Heading:** Your Guide, Your Host, Your Connection to Afghanistan

**Body:**

I grew up in Afghanistan, surrounded by landscapes that most of the world doesn't know exist. Lakes the color of turquoise. Valleys carved by rivers older than recorded history. Communities with a hospitality so deep it changes how you see the world.

For over 15 years, I've been taking people here — journalists working on stories, adventurers chasing the road less traveled, Afghan diaspora reconnecting with the country their parents left behind. Every trip is different. What stays the same is my commitment to keeping people safe and showing them the real Afghanistan.

I speak Dari, Pashto, and English fluently. I've guided groups through every season and most regions of the country. I know which roads are passable, which communities welcome visitors, and how to adapt when plans change — and in Afghanistan, plans always change.

If you come here with me, I'll take care of you. That's a promise.

## 6. Our Approach

**Heading:** How We Work

Three columns, icon + heading + paragraph.

**Hire Local**
Every driver, cook, porter, and interpreter is Afghan. Your money stays in the communities you visit. We also direct a portion of every tour fee into local education and infrastructure projects.

**Honest Communication**
We don't oversell Afghanistan and we don't scare you away from it. Before you book, you'll get a straightforward briefing on current conditions. During the trip, you'll know exactly what's happening.

**Small Groups Only**
We cap group tours at eight people. Smaller groups move faster, integrate better into local communities, and create less impact on the places we visit.
