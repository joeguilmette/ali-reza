### Tour 4: Bamiyan Valley Cultural Trek

**Duration:** 6 Days
**Difficulty:** Moderate
**Group size:** 2–8
**Price:** From $1,100 per person
**Category:** Cultural & Heritage / Adventure

**Hero photo:** Dragon Valley cliffs with the Bamiyan valley floor below.

**Overview:**
Bamiyan Valley is the cultural heart of the Hazarajat — the region of the Hazara people, descendants of the Mongol armies who swept through Central Asia. The valley is defined by the two great niches where the world's largest standing Buddhas once stood before their destruction in 2001. But Bamiyan is far more than that. It is surrounded by extraordinary trekking terrain: Dragon Valley, the Red City, the cliffs of the Band-e-Amir plateau. This trip balances history, hiking, and genuine cultural exchange.

**Highlights:**

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Group size:** 1–8
**Price:** From $450 per person
**Category:** Cultural & Heritage

**Hero photo:** Babur's Gardens with the city below.

**Overview:**
Kabul is not what most people picture. It is a city of two and a half million people, layered with history from the Mughal Empire, the Great Game, the Soviet era, and the decades since. Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, loved Kabul above all his cities and is buried here. The old bazaars predate any map you can find. The food is exceptional.

Afghanistan is one of the most photogenic countries on earth and one of the least photographed by outsiders. This expedition is built around the light. We plan our movements for golden hours, position the group for landscapes that have never been published, and create space for genuine portrait access in communities that rarely see a camera. Ali Reza's relationships with local families and Kyrgyz herders make images possible that simply could not be taken any other way.
