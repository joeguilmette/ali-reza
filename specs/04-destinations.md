### Destination 1: Band-e-Amir & Bamiyan

**Hero photo:** The turquoise lakes of Band-e-Amir, cliffs reflecting in the water.

**Overview**

Band-e-Amir is Afghanistan's first national park — six crater lakes at 2,900 meters whose water is a shade of blue that photographs can't fully capture. They were formed by travertine dams built up over millennia by mineral-rich springs. The surrounding landscape is high steppe: vast, dry, almost lunar. Then the lakes appear and everything changes.

An hour's drive away is Bamiyan Valley, once a great center of Buddhist civilization along the Silk Road. The two towering statues of the Buddha that stood here for 1,500 years were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. The niches remain. The valley around them — dramatic cliffs, a winding river, a living Hazara community — is deeply worth the journey.

**Key Facts**

| | |
|---|---|
| Region | Bamiyan Province, central Afghanistan |
| Altitude | 2,500–3,000m |
| Best Season | April–October |
| Nearest City | Bamiyan (Band-e-Amir is 75km further west) |
| From Kabul | 4-hour overland drive |

**What to See**

**Band-e-Amir Lakes**
Six lakes connected by natural travertine dams. The largest, Band-e-Haibat, is nearly 130 meters deep. Swimming is permitted in designated areas. Local boats available for hire. The cliffs above offer a view that stops every conversation.

**Bamiyan Buddha Niches**
The empty niches where the 55m and 38m Buddhas stood are still monumental. Walking inside the cliff system — through ancient passageways carved by Buddhist monks — is an eerie and moving experience. UNESCO is monitoring and supporting preservation.

**Bamiyan Museum**
A small but serious collection: stucco Buddha heads, Kushan-era coins, painted murals recovered from cave monasteries. One of the best-presented museums in Afghanistan.

**Shahr-e-Zohak (Red City)**
A Ghaznavid fortress perched on a red sandstone outcrop at the junction of two valleys. Mostly ruins, but dramatically sited. 1.5-hour hike from the road. Views extend for 50km on clear days.

**Dragon Valley (Darra-e-Azhdar)**
A hidden canyon near Bamiyan with cave dwellings carved into the cliff walls — some Buddhist, some older. Narrow, wild, almost no visitors.

**Tours That Include This Destination**
- Band-e-Amir Lakes Discovery (5 Days)
- Bamiyan Valley Cultural Trek (6 Days)
- Pamir Photography Expedition (10 Days)

### Destination 2: Wakhan Corridor & Pamir

**Hero photo:** Kyrgyz horsemen on the plateau, mountains in the distance.

**Overview**

The Wakhan Corridor is a political accident that became one of the world's great wilderness destinations. In 1893, the British and Russian empires drew a line here to keep their territories from touching — a narrow finger of land stretching 350 kilometers east, never more than 65km wide, connecting Afghanistan to China. Today it is home to the Wakhi people in the lower valley and the Kyrgyz nomads on the high Pamir plateau above.

There is almost no infrastructure. No paved roads above the first few villages. No phone signal. No tourists. Just an enormous, wild, high-altitude landscape that has changed very little in a thousand years.

**Key Facts**

| | |
|---|---|
| Region | Badakhshan Province, northeastern Afghanistan |
| Altitude | 2,800m (valley floor) to 4,900m (high passes) |
| Best Season | June–September |
| Access | Fly Kabul–Faizabad, then overland 2–3 days |
| Season Note | Corridor inaccessible October–May |

**What to See**

**The Wakhan Valley**
The lower Wakhan is Wakhi territory — a farming and herding culture with deep roots in the Silk Road. Stone fortresses dot the hillsides. The Amu Darya river (the ancient Oxus) forms the border with Tajikistan to the north. Villages of flat-roofed houses, mulberry trees, and apricot orchards.

**The Little Pamir**
The high plateau at the far eastern end of the Corridor. Elevation 4,200–4,500m. The Kyrgyz families who live here year-round have no formal citizenship in any country — they are a people of the plateau. Yak herds. Camel trains. Felt yurts. Extraordinary silence.

**Marco Polo Sheep**
The largest wild sheep in the world, with spiral horns that can reach 1.5 meters. The Pamir is one of their last strongholds. Best sightings: August–September on the high slopes.

**The Big Pamir Lake (Chaqmaqtin)**
A glacial lake at 4,200m on the Little Pamir plateau. One of the most remote lakes in Asia. Snow-capped peaks on all sides.

**Tours That Include This Destination**
- Wakhan Corridor Expedition (12 Days)
- Pamir Photography Expedition (10 Days)

### Destination 3: Kabul & Surroundings

**Hero photo:** Babur's Gardens terraces looking over the city.

**Overview**

Kabul is a city that confounds expectations. With 4–5 million people, it is one of the fastest-growing cities in Asia. It is also one of the oldest — continuously inhabited for 3,500 years. Mughal emperors loved it. The British fought over it twice. The Soviets bombed parts of it. The decades since have added more layers still. Walking its streets with Ali Reza as a guide reveals a city of extraordinary depth and surprising vitality.

**Key Facts**

| | |
|---|---|
| Region | Kabul Province, eastern Afghanistan |
| Altitude | 1,800m |
| Best Season | Year-round (winters cold but manageable) |
| International Flights | Hamid Karzai International Airport |

**What to See**

**Babur's Gardens (Bagh-e-Babur)**
The Mughal emperor Babur laid out these terraced gardens in the early 16th century and requested that he be buried here. He was. The gardens fell into ruin during the civil war and were beautifully restored in the 2000s by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. His marble tomb sits at the top of the hill. The view over Kabul from here is worth the visit alone.

**Kabul Museum**
One of the great museums of the ancient world — or it was, before looting during the civil war destroyed or dispersed much of its collection. What remains is significant: objects from the Kushan, Bactrian, and early Islamic periods. Restoration work is ongoing.

**Chicken Street**
The legendary bazaar for international visitors. Antique dealers, carpet merchants, lapis lazuli jewelry, karakul hats, embroidered textiles. Many pieces are genuinely old. Ali Reza knows which dealers are honest.

**Darul Aman Palace**
A neo-classical palace built in the 1920s by King Amanullah, heavily shelled during the civil war, and now a ruin being stabilized for preservation. The contrast between its European grandeur and its bullet-scarred walls is unforgettable.

**Paghman Gardens**
The summer retreat of Afghan royalty, 40 minutes west of the city in the foothills. A triumphal arch, formal gardens, and a very different pace from the capital. Popular with Kabul families on Fridays.

**Murad Khane**
The surviving historic quarter of old Kabul — a dense maze of traditional courtyard houses, merchant residences, and narrow lanes. Also restored by the Aga Khan Trust. Walking here feels like stepping 200 years back.

**Tours That Include This Destination**
- Kabul Deep Dive (3 Days)
- Band-e-Amir Lakes Discovery (5 Days)
- Bamiyan Valley Cultural Trek (6 Days)

**Photo Gallery**
Six images: Babur's tomb, Chicken Street, Darul Aman ruins, old city lanes, Paghman arch, Kabul cityscape.

### Destination 4: Mazar-e-Sharif & Balkh

**Hero photo:** The Blue Mosque at dusk, its tilework glowing.

**Overview**

Mazar-e-Sharif means "Tomb of the Exalted." It is named for the shrine believed by many to hold the remains of Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. The shrine — the Blue Mosque — is the most physically stunning building in Afghanistan: an enormous compound of blue and turquoise tilework, thronged with thousands of white doves, open to visitors of all faiths. The city around it is cosmopolitan, prosperous, and hospitable.

Twenty kilometers away, Balkh sits quietly in the dust. It was one of the greatest cities of the ancient world — capital of Bactria, stopping point for Alexander the Great, early center of Zoroastrianism, and later a jewel of early Islamic culture. The poet Rumi was born here. The ruins of the ancient walls extend for kilometers. Very few people have been.

**Key Facts**

| | |
|---|---|
| Region | Balkh Province, northern Afghanistan |
| Altitude | 377m |
| Best Season | Year-round; spring (March–May) is spectacular |
| From Kabul | 1-hour domestic flight |

**What to See**

**The Blue Mosque (Shrine of Hazrat Ali)**
Open dawn to dusk. The tilework changes color through the day — indigo in morning shade, brilliant turquoise in afternoon sun. The white doves are fed by the mosque staff; they cover the courtyard at prayer time. Non-Muslim visitors are welcomed but should dress modestly and follow the guidance of Ali Reza.

**Balkh: The Mother of Cities**
The ancient city walls of Balkh span 8km in circumference — and they were built on top of even older walls. Inside: the Mosque of Nine Domes, the Green Mosque, the shrine of Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa. The scale of the ancient city, now empty scrubland broken by ruins, is difficult to comprehend.

**Mazar Bazaar**
One of the best bazaars in the country. The carpet market is particularly strong — northern Afghan Uzbek and Turkmen carpets are among the finest in the world. The spice section, the dried-fruit sellers, and the karakul hat merchants are worth hours.

**Nawruz**
If visiting in late March, the Nawruz (Persian New Year) celebrations in Mazar are extraordinary — tens of thousands of Afghans converge on the Blue Mosque for the raising of the janda flag, music, traditional sports, and street food.

**Tours That Include This Destination**
- Ancient Silk Road — Balkh & Mazar (4 Days)

**Photo Gallery**
Six images: Blue Mosque facade, doves in the courtyard, interior tilework, Balkh ruins, bazaar, Nawruz celebration.

### Destination 5: Nuristan & Kunar

**Hero photo:** Wooden carved houses on a forested mountain slope.

**Overview**

Nuristan — "Land of Light" — was the last region of Afghanistan to be converted to Islam, only in 1896. Before that, its people practiced an ancient polytheistic religion related to early Vedic traditions. The legacy of that distinct culture persists in the extraordinary carved wooden architecture found nowhere else in Afghanistan: multi-story houses with intricate geometric carvings, columns, and balconies built into steep forested mountain slopes. The landscape itself is unlike the rest of the country — deep river gorges, dense cedar forests, mountains that feel more like the Alps than Central Asia.

**Note:** This destination requires more logistical preparation and is only offered as a custom trip. Contact Ali Reza to discuss.

**Key Facts**

| | |
|---|---|
| Region | Nuristan & Kunar Provinces, eastern Afghanistan |
| Altitude | 1,200–3,800m |
| Best Season | May–September |
| Access | Overland from Kabul (8–10 hours) |
| Booking | Custom trips only |

**What to See**

**Kamdesh & the Bashgal Valley**
The heartland of Nuristani culture. Traditional multi-story wooden houses. Carved pillars and facades. Old men who remember the time before conversion. Ali Reza has established relationships with village elders here.

**The Kunar River Valley**
Dramatic river gorge running south from Nuristan. The river is one of the most powerful in Afghanistan and the gorge walls are near-vertical in places.

**Nuristani Woodcarving**
Recognizable by its geometric interlace patterns and stylized animal motifs. Found on house facades, furniture, and grave markers. The craftsmen are still active — it is possible to watch work in progress.

### Destination 6: Bamyan Highlands

**Hero photo:** Rolling highland steppe, a single road cutting through, mountains in distance.

**Overview**

The Hazarajat highlands — the broad plateau surrounding Bamiyan Valley — are a world of open sky and silence. At 3,000–4,000 meters, the air is thin and clear. In summer the plateau is green; in autumn it goes gold. The Hazara communities scattered across this landscape have a particular identity — descended from the Mongols who swept through in the 13th century, Shia Muslim, historically marginalized, and fiercely proud. Traveling here, slowly, overland, staying in family guesthouses, is one of the most memorable things a visitor can do in Afghanistan.

**Key Facts**

| | |
|---|---|
| Region | Bamiyan Province and surrounding highlands |
| Altitude | 2,800–4,000m |
| Best Season | May–October |
| Access | Overland from Kabul or Bamiyan |

**What to See**

**The Highland Road**
The drive from Kabul to Bamiyan through the Hazarajat is itself an attraction — mountain passes, gorges, high plateau, small roadside villages where travelers can stop for tea and bread.

**Hazara Villages**
Flat-roofed houses of mud brick. Women in bright clothing working in fields. Children who have rarely seen foreign visitors. Hospitality that feels unconditional.

**Ajar Valley**
A remote valley east of Bamiyan with a river, wildlife, and almost no visitors. Day hike or overnight. Ibex are commonly seen on the upper slopes.

**Highland Trekking**
The plateau offers multi-day trekking with village-to-village overnight stays. No technical climbing. Routes pass through terrain that has no English-language guidebook description.

**Tours That Include This Destination**
- Bamiyan Valley Cultural Trek (6 Days)
- Band-e-Amir Lakes Discovery (5 Days)
- Custom trips

**Photo Gallery**
